EI - Exercise Fortran (Diego Ontiveros)

The program takes a user input filename from the molecules available in the /molecules folder, reads all the coordinates and returns the molecular mass, the maximum and minimum distances and their correspondent atoms (with and without considering Hydrogen atoms), and the number of selected groups, in this case, hydroxyls (OH) and carbonyls (CO).

In the program folder are contained the original .f90 files separated by the main program and the two functions used, a makefile to create the combined final executable, and the final executable (programa.x) after the makefile is done.
